My Android sneaker app prototype

This is the prototype app I wrote for a final project in my Mobile Apps development course in my final semester at Georgia State University. The core logic is not there, however, I have resumed this project in my Sneaker Game App for iOS. I will be transferring this app to a React Native app at a later date.
